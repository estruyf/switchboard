// faint grid of jack holes, the app's own yellow is the cable, and the four status colours the app uses (needs
// you, working, running in the background, unread) are the lit jacks. All of them are the app's dark-theme values
// (apps/ui/src/styles.css), so nothing on the ground disagrees with what is in the windows.
