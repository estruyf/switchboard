# Themes

A theme colours Switchboard: the app, code blocks and diffs, and the terminal, in a light and a dark version. It is one JSON file. Pick, import and export themes in **Settings → Theme**; see the [README](../README.md#themes) for how that works. This page is the file format.

## The smallest theme

A background (`canvas`) and an `accent` per mode are enough. Everything else is generated from them, solved to stay readable:

```json
{
  "name": "Mint",
  "version": 1,
  "dark": { "canvas": "#0f1a17", "accent": "#3ddc97" }
}
```

This one has only a dark version, so in light mode Switchboard uses Demo Time.

## The file

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/estruyf/switchboard/main/docs/switchboard-theme.schema.json",
  "name": "Solarized",          // required, 1 to 48 characters
  "author": "Ethan Schoonover",  // optional
  "version": 1,                 // required: the theme format, 1
  "light": { "canvas": "…", "accent": "…", "colors": { … }, "syntax": … },
  "dark":  { "canvas": "…", "accent": "…", "colors": { … }, "terminal": { … }, "syntax": … }
}
```

- **`light` and `dark`**: at least one. A missing mode uses Demo Time, and Settings says so.
- **`canvas` and `accent`** (per mode, optional): the background and the accent every missing colour is generated from.
- **`colors`** (per mode, optional): any of the [tokens](#every-token-and-where-it-shows) by their name. They win over what canvas and accent generate. Without `canvas`, the mode's `colors.bg` stands in for it (and `colors.accent` for `accent`); without those either, Demo Time's.
- **`terminal`**: the terminal's colours. Only read from `dark`, because the terminal panel is always dark.
- **`syntax`** (per mode, optional): the [code colours](#code-colours). Missing means Demo Time's.
- **`$schema`** points editors such as VS Code at [switchboard-theme.schema.json](switchboard-theme.schema.json), for completion and checks while you type. Exports always include it.
- **`$comment`** may be a string or a list of strings, at the top level, in a mode, or in `colors`, for notes. It is ignored.
- Files may have comments (`//`, `/* */`) and trailing commas, as VS Code's theme files do.
- **Unknown keys are ignored**, and the import lists them ("Ignored 2 unknown keys: `colors.tab-bg`, `fonts`").

Here is Solarized with both modes, a few colours of its own, its terminal and Shiki's Solarized code colours:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/estruyf/switchboard/main/docs/switchboard-theme.schema.json",
  "name": "Solarized",
  "author": "Ethan Schoonover",
  "version": 1,
  "light": {
    "canvas": "#fdf6e3",
    "accent": "#b58900",
    "colors": { "sidebar": "#eee8d5", "text": "#073642", "muted": "#586e75" },
    "syntax": "solarized-light"
  },
  "dark": {
    "canvas": "#002b36",
    "accent": "#b58900",
    "colors": { "sidebar": "#073642", "card": "#073642", "text": "#93a1a1", "muted": "#839496" },
    "terminal": {
      "background": "#001e26",
      "foreground": "#93a1a1",
      "cursor": "#b58900",
      "ansi": ["#073642", "#dc322f", "#859900", "#b58900", "#268bd2", "#d33682", "#2aa198", "#eee8d5", "#002b36", "#cb4b16", "#586e75", "#657b83", "#839496", "#6c71c4", "#93a1a1", "#fdf6e3"]
    },
    "syntax": "solarized-dark"
  }
}
```

And Demo Time, the built-in theme, which sets every token (exporting it from Settings gives you this file as a starting point):

    }
  }
}
```

## Colour values

A theme holds colours and nothing else. Every value must be one of:

- `#rgb`, `#rrggbb` or `#rrggbbaa`
- `rgb()` or `rgba()`, with commas or spaces: `rgb(21 24 31 / 0.35)`
- `hsl()` or `hsla()`: `hsl(210 40% 50%)`
- `oklch()`: `oklch(0.7 0.1 250 / 50%)`

Anything else (named colours such as `red`, `url()`, `var()`, `color-mix()`, `;`, `}`) refuses the whole file, with where the first problem is:

> `dark.colors.bg` uses `url(…)`. Themes can only hold colour values: #hex, rgb(), hsl() or oklch().

Nothing is added then. The same check applies to the terminal and to inline code themes, so a theme file can never add CSS of its own.

## How missing colours are generated

For each mode, Switchboard first generates every token from `canvas` and `accent`, then applies `colors` on top, then works out the tokens that follow from others (`selected` from `text`, `focus-ring` from `accent-ink`, `diff-added` and `diff-removed` from `ok` and `error`) unless `colors` sets them. The maths is in OKLCH, so lightness steps look even:

| Tokens | Generated as |
|---|---|
| `bg` | the canvas |
| `sidebar`, `card`, `popover`, `code-bg` | steps from the canvas: lighter in dark mode, darker in light mode, with a hint of the accent's hue when the canvas has none of its own |
| `border`, `overlay-border` | further steps from the canvas |
| `text`, `muted` | at least 4.5:1 (WCAG AA) on the canvas, the sidebar and cards |
| `faint` | at least 3:1 |
| `accent` | the accent, as given |
| `accent-ink` | the accent's hue, moved until it reaches 4.5:1 on `bg` |
| `on-accent` | black or white, whichever reads better on the accent |
| `link`, `unread` | the accent when it is blue-ish, otherwise Demo Time's blue; 4.5:1 on `bg` |
| `ok`, `warn`, `error`, `caution` | Demo Time's hues, moved to 4.5:1 on `bg`, so they keep their meaning (pink still needs you) |
| `profile-*` | Demo Time's hues, moved to 3:1 on `bg` |
| `selected` | `text` at 10% (light) or 11% (dark) |
| `focus-ring` | `accent-ink` at 55% |
| `diff-added`, `diff-removed` | `ok` and `error` at 14% |
| `scrim`, `overlay-shadow`, `terminal-shadow` | near-black at Demo Time's strengths |
| `terminal-bg` | dark in both modes, in the canvas's hue |

From Demo Time's own canvas and accent, the generator lands close to Demo Time. The differences: `on-accent` is pure black (Demo Time uses its near-black `#15181f`); on a white canvas the greys and text take a hint of the yellow accent instead of Demo Time's cool blue-grey; the diff backgrounds are 14% (Demo Time's are 12%); `accent-ink` (`#8f7400` instead of `#916c00`) and dark `warn` are solved to just 4.5:1. Demo Time itself always uses its exact values.

When a theme is imported, the dialog lists which colours are generated, with swatches, and warns about any pair under WCAG AA: text and muted text on the background, text on the accent, and code (plain and comments) on the code background. The theme still imports.

## Every token and where it shows

The names are the `--sb-*` CSS variables without the prefix. Values are Demo Time's.

| Token | Where it shows | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bg` | the conversation, the window behind everything, fields | `#ffffff` | `#15181f` |
| `sidebar` | the sidebar and side panels | `#f4f6fa` | `#202736` |
| `card` | cards: your prompt, plans, permission and question cards, the message box, theme cards | `#ffffff` | `#202736` |
| `popover` | menus, popovers, dialogs, toasts | `#ffffff` | `#2a3244` |
| `code-bg` | code blocks, tool output, inline and Changes diffs | `#f4f6fa` | `#202736` |
| `border` | lines between areas, card edges | `#e1e4e8` | `#2d3142` |
| `overlay-border` | edges of menus and dialogs, and of fields, chips and secondary buttons inside them | `#d1d5da` | `#414861` |
| `overlay-shadow` | the shadow under menus and dialogs (one colour; the app builds the layers) | `#15181f33` | `#000000b3` |
| `text` | text | `#202736` | `#d9dbe1` |
| `muted` | secondary text, quiet icons | `#505869` | `#9ba4b7` |
| `faint` | small hints, ages, placeholders | `#687082` | `#8b94a6` |
| `link` | links and link-like buttons (Undo) | `#005cc5` | `#74c0fc` |
| `selected` | the selected row (usually translucent) | `#2027361a` | `#d9dbe11c` |
| `focus-ring` | the outline around the focused control while moving with Tab | `#916c008c` | `#ffd43b8c` |
| `scrim` | the backdrop behind dialogs | `#15181f59` | `#00000099` |
| `ok` | running in the background, success, added lines' marks, usage under 60% | `#00806f` | `#51cf66` |
| `warn` | needs you: a permission or a question (pink) | `#d1186b` | `#ed217c` |
| `error` | failures, removed lines' marks, usage from 85% | `#d73a49` | `#ff6b6b` |
| `caution` | a level getting high: usage bars and the context ring from 60% | `#b35900` | `#ffa94d` |
| `unread` | finished and not read yet: rail, dot | `#005cc5` | `#74c0fc` |
| `accent` | primary buttons and tints (Demo Time's yellow) | `#ffd43b` | `#ffd43b` |
| `accent-ink` | the accent as text, icons, spinners, working dots and borders | `#916c00` | `#ffd43b` |
| `on-accent` | text on an accent fill | `#15181f` | `#15181f` |
| `diff-added` | the background of added lines | `#00806f1f` | `#51cf661f` |
| `diff-removed` | the background of removed lines | `#d73a491f` | `#ff6b6b1f` |
| `terminal-bg` | the terminal panel (always dark) | `#0d1016` | `#0d1016` |
| `terminal-shadow` | the shadow the terminal panel casts on the conversation | `#15181f29` | `#0000008c` |
| `profile-yellow`, `-blue`, `-green`, `-purple`, `-red`, `-orange`, `-gray` | the dots, tags and rails that tell Claude profiles apart | see Demo Time above | |

The terminal panel always uses the dark mode's tokens, in light mode too.

## Code colours

Without `syntax`, code keeps Demo Time's colours. Per mode, `syntax` is one of:

- **The name of a bundled Shiki theme**, loaded the first time it is used. One of: `andromeeda`, `aurora-x`, `ayu-dark`, `ayu-light`, `ayu-mirage`, `catppuccin-frappe`, `catppuccin-latte`, `catppuccin-macchiato`, `catppuccin-mocha`, `dark-plus`, `dracula`, `dracula-soft`, `everforest-dark`, `everforest-light`, `github-dark`, `github-dark-default`, `github-dark-dimmed`, `github-dark-high-contrast`, `github-light`, `github-light-default`, `github-light-high-contrast`, `gruvbox-dark-hard`, `gruvbox-dark-medium`, `gruvbox-dark-soft`, `gruvbox-light-hard`, `gruvbox-light-medium`, `gruvbox-light-soft`, `houston`, `kanagawa-dragon`, `kanagawa-lotus`, `kanagawa-wave`, `light-plus`, `material-theme`, `material-theme-darker`, `material-theme-lighter`, `material-theme-ocean`, `material-theme-palenight`, `min-dark`, `min-light`, `monokai`, `night-owl`, `night-owl-light`, `nord`, `one-dark-pro`, `one-light`, `poimandres`, `rose-pine`, `rose-pine-dawn`, `rose-pine-moon`, `slack-dark`, `slack-ochin`, `snazzy-light`, `solarized-dark`, `solarized-light`, `synthwave-84`, `tokyo-night`, `vesper`, `vitesse-black`, `vitesse-dark`, `vitesse-light`. Another name is refused, with a hint for a typo ("Did you mean “solarized-dark”?").
- **An inline TextMate theme**, such as the `tokenColors` of a VS Code theme. Only `name`, `type` and `tokenColors` are read, and of each rule only `scope`, `settings.foreground` (a [colour value](#colour-values)) and `settings.fontStyle` (`italic`, `bold`, `underline`, or several separated by spaces). Its `colors` and `editor.*` keys are ignored.

  ```json
  "syntax": {
    "name": "Mine",
    "type": "dark",
    "tokenColors": [
      { "scope": ["comment"], "settings": { "foreground": "#7f8c98", "fontStyle": "italic" } },
      { "scope": ["keyword", "storage"], "settings": { "foreground": "#ff7ab2" } },
      { "scope": "string", "settings": { "foreground": "#a3e635" } }
    ]
  }
  ```

The background of code is always the theme's `code-bg`, never the syntax theme's, and diffs use `diff-added` and `diff-removed`. Light and dark code colours switch with the app, without highlighting again.

## The terminal

`dark.terminal` sets the terminal panel's colours: `background`, `foreground`, `cursor`, `selection`, and `ansi`, exactly 16 colours: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, then the bright versions in the same order. Each one is optional: without it, the terminal uses the dark mode's `terminal-bg`, `text` and `accent-ink`, the accent at 25% for the selection, and Demo Time's ANSI colours. A `background` here also colours the panel around the terminal, unless `colors.terminal-bg` says otherwise.

## Importing, exporting and editing

- **Import** (Settings → Theme → *Import…*, *Import theme…* in the command palette, or a `.json` dropped on the window outside a session's message box) checks the file and shows a preview before anything is added. A theme with the name of one you have asks whether to replace it or keep both (the copy is named "Solarized 2"); a built-in theme's name always keeps both.
- **Imported themes** are files in the `themes` folder of Switchboard's app data (`~/Library/Application Support/Switchboard/themes`); *Open themes folder* shows it. Switchboard watches the folder: edit the theme in use and it applies when you save. If the change isn't valid, the last version that worked stays in use and Settings → Theme says what is wrong.
- **Export** writes the theme as `<name>.json` (`solarized.json`), always with `$schema`. It writes `canvas` and `accent` and only the colours that differ from what those generate, so the file stays short and imports to exactly the same colours. Exporting Demo Time writes every token.
- **Duplicate** saves a copy of any theme as a new imported one, ready to edit.
- **Remove** moves an imported theme's file to the Trash. Built-in themes can't be removed. Removing the theme in use goes back to Demo Time.
- **Settings → Backup** can include your imported themes.

## Built-in themes

| Theme | Light | Dark | Code colours |
|---|---|---|---|
| Demo Time | Demo Time Light | Demo Time Dark | Demo Time |
| GitHub | GitHub Light Default | GitHub Dark Default | `github-light-default` / `github-dark-default` |
| GitHub High Contrast | GitHub Light High Contrast | GitHub Dark High Contrast | `github-light-high-contrast` / `github-dark-high-contrast` |
| VS Code | Light Modern | Dark Modern | `light-plus` / `dark-plus` (Modern uses the Plus code colours) |
| VS Code High Contrast | Light High Contrast | Dark High Contrast | inline themes converted from VS Code's high contrast token colours |

They are theme files like any other ([apps/ui/src/themes](../apps/ui/src/themes)), checked the same way as imports. Each sets canvas and accent from the source's editor background and main accent, takes the colours the source clearly defines (sidebar, widgets and menus, borders, text and description text, links, git decoration and error colours, code block background, diff backgrounds, terminal), and leaves the rest to generation. Where the source has no colour for one of Switchboard's states (pink for "needs you", blue for "unread"), the closest colour from its own palette is used; each file's `$comment` notes those choices. Every built-in reaches WCAG AA for text and muted text in both modes; the high contrast ones reach AAA (7:1), keep borders visible on every surface, and have a visible focus ring.
