# Project actions

Project actions are in the **⋯** menu of a session's header, for the things you do over and over: commit, run the tests, start the dev server, publish. An action either **runs a command** in a terminal tab or **asks Claude** something, as if you'd typed it.

[← Back to the README](../README.md)

## Adding an action

1. Open a session in the project.
2. Click **⋯** in the header, then **Add an action…** (**Edit actions…** once you have some).
3. Pick a suggestion or fill in your own:

| Field | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Name** and **icon** | How it looks in the menu. |
| **Run a command** / **Ask Claude** | A command runs in your login shell in a terminal tab below the session, so your `PATH`, `nvm` and aliases work as they do in your terminal. A prompt is sent to Claude in the session, and can be a `/` command. |
| **Saved for** | *This project*, or *All projects* for actions you want everywhere. |
| **Runs in** | The session's folder (its worktree, if it has one) or the project root. |
| **Shortcut** | Optional, for example ⌘⇧T. |
| **Ask before running** | Shows a confirmation first. Useful for publish or deploy. |
| **Run in every new worktree** | Runs before Claude starts in each new worktree session, for example to install dependencies. Claude's first message waits until it has finished. |

Your actions are listed under **Project actions** in the **⋯** menu, with their shortcuts. Use **Edit actions…** there to change or remove them.

### Suggestions

When you add an action, Switchboard suggests some to start from:

- your `package.json` scripts (with npm, pnpm, yarn or bun, whichever the project uses), plus *Install*
- *Commit* (asks Claude to commit with a clear message), *Push* (`git push`) and *Create PR* (`gh pr create --web`)

## Variables

Commands and prompts can use these, filled in when the action runs:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `${cwd}` | The session's folder |
| `${projectRoot}` | The project's root folder |
| `${branch}` | The current branch |
| `${worktreeName}` | The worktree's name, if the session has one |
| `${sessionId}` | The session's ID |
| `${sessionTitle}` | The session's title |

In commands, every value is quoted for the shell, so a branch name or title can never run anything by accident.

## Sharing actions with your team

Put a `.switchboard.json` file in the root of the repository and commit it. Everyone using Switchboard on that repo gets its actions.

```json
{
  "actions": [
    { "name": "Test", "icon": "flask", "command": "npm test" },
    { "name": "Dev server", "icon": "play", "command": "npm run dev", "shortcut": "cmd+shift+d" },
    { "name": "Install", "icon": "package", "command": "npm install", "runOnWorktreeCreate": true },
    { "name": "Publish", "icon": "rocket", "command": "npm publish", "confirm": true, "cwd": "project-root" },
    { "name": "Review", "icon": "sparkles", "type": "prompt", "command": "Review the changes on ${branch} and list anything risky." }
  ]
}
```

| Key | Default | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | (required) | Up to 40 characters |
| `command` | (required) | The command, or the prompt for `"type": "prompt"` |
| `type` | `"shell"` | `"shell"` or `"prompt"` |
| `icon` | `"play"` | `play`, `rocket`, `git-commit`, `git-pull-request`, `upload`, `flask`, `package`, `terminal`, `sparkles`, `wrench`, `globe`, `bug`, `check` |
| `cwd` | `"session"` | `"session"` or `"project-root"` |
| `confirm` | `false` | Ask before running |
| `shortcut` | none | For example `"cmd+shift+t"` |
| `runOnWorktreeCreate` | `false` | Run in every new worktree before Claude starts |
| `id` | from the name | Lowercase letters, digits and dashes |

Actions with the same `id` (by default, the same name) replace each other: your actions for this project win over shared ones, and shared ones win over your *All projects* actions. Shared actions can't be edited in the app; change `.switchboard.json` instead.

**Safety:** a command from a repository could do anything, so Switchboard shows you the exact command the first time you run a shared action and asks you to approve it. If someone changes the command later, you're asked again.

## Project icons

Switchboard picks up a project's icon from the repository when it can: a logo or favicon in the usual places, the `icon` in `package.json`, or an `iconPath` you set in `.switchboard.json`:

```json
{ "iconPath": "assets/logo.svg" }
```

You can also set your own: right-click a session (or use the project filter at the top of the sidebar) and choose **Choose image…** or **Use emoji…**.
