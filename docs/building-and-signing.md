# Building, signing and notarisation

How to package Switchboard as a Mac app, and how to sign and notarise it with an Apple Developer ID so it opens on any Mac without warnings.

[← Back to the README](../README.md)

## Building the app

Needs macOS on Apple Silicon, Node 24+ and npm 11+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dist
```

This builds `apps/desktop/dist/mac-arm64/Switchboard.app` and `apps/desktop/dist/Switchboard-<version>-arm64.dmg`. Open the `.dmg` and drag Switchboard to Applications.

It also writes what the in-app updater needs: `Switchboard-<version>-arm64-mac.zip` (Squirrel.Mac installs from the zip, not the `.dmg`), its `.blockmap`, and the update feed `latest-mac.yml`. Inside the app, `Contents/Resources/app-update.yml` tells the updater where to look (the GitHub releases of `estruyf/switchboard`, from the `publish` section of `electron-builder.yml`). electron-builder never uploads anything itself (`--publish never`); the release workflow does.

### Preview builds

For a build that must never update or be offered as an update (a test build from a pull request, say), use:

```bash
npm run dist:preview
```

It uses [`electron-builder.preview.yml`](../apps/desktop/electron-builder.preview.yml), which is the normal configuration with `publish: null`: the app has no `app-update.yml` (Settings → About says updates are off) and no `latest-mac.yml` is written.

Switchboard uses your installed Claude Code (`claude` on your PATH) and its login; it doesn't ship its own copy.

### Opening an unsigned build

Without a Developer ID certificate, the build is unsigned. On the Mac that built it, it opens normally. If you copy it to another Mac, macOS blocks the first launch: right-click the app and choose **Open**, or run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Switchboard.app
```

## Signing and notarisation

With an Apple Developer ID, the app is signed with the hardened runtime and notarised by Apple.

1. **Signing identity.** `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` must list your `Developer ID Application` certificate. It needs its private key in the keychain (made from a certificate request on this Mac, or imported as a `.p12`) and Apple's [Developer ID G2 intermediate](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/DeveloperIDG2CA.cer). With that in place, `npm run dist` signs automatically.
2. **Notarisation credentials, once.** Create an app-specific password at [account.apple.com](https://account.apple.com) (Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords), then store it in your keychain:

   ```bash
   xcrun notarytool store-credentials switchboard-notary --apple-id you@example.com --team-id YOURTEAMID
   ```

   It prompts for the password; nothing is written to the repository.
3. **Build:**

   ```bash
   npm run dist:notarized
   ```

   This signs the app, sends it to Apple's notary service (usually a few minutes), and staples the ticket to the app.

### Checking the result

```bash
spctl -a -vv apps/desktop/dist/mac-arm64/Switchboard.app
xcrun stapler validate apps/desktop/dist/mac-arm64/Switchboard.app
```

`spctl` should say `accepted` and `source=Notarized Developer ID`.

The `.dmg` itself isn't signed or notarised (electron-builder doesn't by default). That's fine for installing: the app inside carries its own stapled ticket.

### What's in the package

The configuration is in [`apps/desktop/electron-builder.yml`](../apps/desktop/electron-builder.yml), and the hardened-runtime entitlements in [`apps/desktop/build/entitlements.mac.plist`](../apps/desktop/build/entitlements.mac.plist). Electron's V8 needs JIT and unsigned executable memory; nothing else is opted out of.

- The Agent SDK's bundled `claude` binary is left out; the user's own `claude` is used.
- `node-pty` is unpacked from the asar archive, because its native helper must be executable.
- Electron is pinned to an exact version, which electron-builder needs.

## Releasing (automated in GitHub Actions)

[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) runs when a release is published on GitHub. To release:

1. Add a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section to [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md), written for people using the app.
2. Retake the README screenshots with `npm run screenshots` (see [README screenshots](development.md#readme-screenshots)) and look at each one: does it still match the app and the README text, and does it show what this release changed? A failing run means a view in the tour has changed; fix the tour instead of keeping the old pictures. Commit the images with the CHANGELOG and push.
3. On GitHub, create a release with a new tag `vX.Y.Z` (Releases → Draft a new release) and publish it. You can leave the notes empty.

The workflow then:

1. runs the typecheck and unit tests;
2. builds the app on an Apple Silicon runner, with the version taken from the tag;
3. signs it with your Developer ID, and notarises and staples it;
4. checks the signature and that Gatekeeper accepts it as notarised;
5. attaches `Switchboard-X.Y.Z-arm64.dmg`, the `.zip` and its `.blockmap` to the release, then the update feed (`latest-mac.yml`) last, so the feed never points at a file that isn't there yet;
6. fails if a `latest*.yml` ended up on a draft or pre-release;
7. fills in the release notes from the CHANGELOG section, if you left them empty. The in-app updater shows these notes (cleaned up and shortened) for the new version.
8. for a Stable release, stamps the Homebrew cask with the version and the `.zip`'s checksum and pushes it to [estruyf/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/estruyf/homebrew-tap) (see [Homebrew](homebrew.md)).

Everyone on the Stable channel is offered the release within a few hours, or straight away with **Check for Updates…**.

### Channels and pre-releases

- **Stable:** a normal (not pre-release) release with a version like `v1.2.3`. Its feed is `latest-mac.yml`, and the updater finds it as the repository's latest release.
- **Nightly:** a *pre-release* tagged like `v1.2.3-nightly.20261006.1`. The workflow builds it with `-c.publish.channel=nightly`, so its feed is `nightly-mac.yml`, which only apps on the Nightly channel look for. A nightly version published as a normal release fails the workflow. There is no scheduled nightly workflow yet; publish one by hand when you want to.
- **Any other pre-release** (`v1.2.3-beta.1`, say) gets the `.dmg` and `.zip` but no feed, so no one is updated to it. A pre-release version published as a normal release fails the workflow, since Stable users would be offered it.

Only arm64 is built. If an Intel build is added, both architectures must go into one `latest-mac.yml` (a `files` entry each) rather than two feeds overwriting each other.

Nothing is attached unsigned: without the secrets below the run fails. To retry, re-run the failed workflow run from the Actions tab.

### Signing secrets

Add these repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

| Secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `MAC_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64` | Your *Developer ID Application* certificate **with its private key**, exported from Keychain Access as a `.p12`, then base64-encoded: `base64 -i DeveloperID.p12 \| pbcopy` |
| `MAC_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | The password you gave the `.p12` when exporting it. Leave it out if the `.p12` has no password |
| `APPLE_ID` | The Apple ID of your developer account |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | An app-specific password for it ([account.apple.com](https://account.apple.com) → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords) |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Your team ID (the 10 characters in brackets after your name in the certificate) |
| `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` | A fine-grained token with *Contents: read and write* on `estruyf/homebrew-tap` only. Without it the release still succeeds and the tap keeps the previous version (see [Homebrew](homebrew.md)) |

`MAC_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` may be left out only if the `.p12` was exported without a password.

### Testing the packaged app

```bash
npm run smoke:packaged
```

Runs the smoke test (see [Development](development.md)) against `dist/mac-arm64/Switchboard.app` instead of the development build.

## Testing updates with the mock server

[`apps/desktop/scripts/mock-update-server.ts`](../apps/desktop/scripts/mock-update-server.ts) serves an update feed on `http://localhost:8484`. Starting Switchboard with `SWITCHBOARD_MOCK_UPDATES=1` points the updater at it instead of GitHub (set `SWITCHBOARD_MOCK_UPDATES_URL` for another port). Nothing is published.

**The check and the UI**, with a made-up feed (works from a development build too):

```bash
npm run mock-updates -w @switchboard/desktop -- --fake 9.9.9
SWITCHBOARD_MOCK_UPDATES=1 npm run dev
```

Settings → About → *Check for Updates* finds v9.9.9 with its release notes, and the update message shows in the window's corner. Downloading fails, since there is no build behind a fake feed. `--fake 9.9.9-nightly.20261006.1` serves `nightly-mac.yml` for the Nightly channel. The smoke test runs one check against the mock feed when `SWITCHBOARD_MOCK_UPDATES=1` is set (it never downloads).

**The whole flow** (download, restart, *Updated to vX*) needs two signed builds, since Squirrel.Mac only installs an update signed by the same Developer ID:

1. Build the newer version and keep its `dist` folder: `npm pkg set version=0.0.9 -w @switchboard/desktop && npm run dist`, then move `apps/desktop/dist` to, say, `/tmp/switchboard-0.0.9`.
2. Build and install the current version as usual (put `version` back first).
3. Serve the newer one: `npm run mock-updates -w @switchboard/desktop -- --dir /tmp/switchboard-0.0.9`.
4. Open the installed app with the mock feed: `SWITCHBOARD_MOCK_UPDATES=1 /Applications/Switchboard.app/Contents/MacOS/Switchboard`.

`SWITCHBOARD_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=1` turns updates off for a run, with that reason shown in Settings → About. `Switchboard --version` prints the version and exits.
