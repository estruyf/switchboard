  # Switchboard updates itself from the release feed, so `brew upgrade` leaves it alone rather than
  # race the in-app updater. The tap still moves on every release, which is what `--greedy` and a
  # fresh `brew install` read.
  # Only an Apple Silicon build is released, and LSMinimumSystemVersion is 13.0 (Electron's floor).
  # The in-app updater has no floor of its own, so `macos` has to move whenever Electron's does.
