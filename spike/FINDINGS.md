# Phase 0 spike: findings

Run on 2026-10-05 against Claude Code **2.1.285** (`/opt/homebrew/bin/claude`), `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` **0.3.288**, Node 24.21, macOS. The scripts in this folder reproduce each result:

```bash
cd spike && npm install
SPIKE_SANDBOX=/path/to/throwaway/git/repo node 01-auth-stream.mjs
```

| # | Script | Question |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | `01-auth-stream.mjs` | Auth, streaming input across turns, init payload, introspection calls |
| 02 | `02-permissions-rewind-interrupt.mjs`, `02b-interrupt.mjs` | Permission prompts, deny, AskUserQuestion, rewind, interrupt |
| 03 | `03-state-warm.mjs` | Session state events, `startup()` pre-warm |
| 04 | `04-disk.mjs` | Live registry + JSONL formats, listing/scan speed |

## Verdict: the plan holds

Everything the plan depends on works. Three things change the design:
1. **Worktrees come for free.** Claude Code creates them itself, so the app doesn't have to.
2. **Live status needs an environment variable switched on.**
3. **The engine must survive SDK errors without crashing.**

All three are detailed below.

---

## 1. Auth ✅ uses the existing Claude Code login
- With `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` set to the installed `claude` and **no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`**, `init.apiKeySource` is `'none'` and `accountInfo().subscriptionType` is `'Claude Max'`. The SDK runs on the user's subscription login with no extra setup.
- `accountInfo()` returns `email, organization, subscriptionType, apiProvider`. Show it in Settings so the user can see which account is in use.
- 📝 **Terms of use** are still a product question rather than a technical one. This is a personal local tool driving your own CLI, which is the same model t3code uses.

## 2. Streaming input ✅ one long-lived `Query` per session
- A push-based `AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>` keeps one process alive across turns. There's no respawn per message.
- **Cold start:** `system:init` at about 600 ms, first token about 1.5–2.4 s.
- **`init` is emitted on every turn, not just once.** The first one arrives before MCP servers connect (32 tools); the next one carries the full set (128 tools). The UI must treat `init` as a *refresh*, not a one-time setup.
- Other system events seen: `commands_changed`, `hook_started/response`, `status`, `thinking_tokens`, `task_summary`, `post_turn_summary`, `rate_limit_event`, `background_tasks_changed`, `task_started`. The renderer needs a no-op default so unknown events never break it.

## 3. Introspection ✅ everything a GUI needs
| Call | Result (this machine) |
|---|---|
| `supportedCommands()` | 106 commands, including all your skills and plugins, shaped `{name, description, argumentHint}` |
| `supportedModels()` | `default opus claude-fable-5-1 sonnet haiku claude-sonnet-5 …` |
| `supportedAgents()` | 15 (your custom agents included) |
| `mcpServerStatus()` | per-server `connected` / `needs-auth`, so the panel can offer "authenticate" |
| `getContextUsage()` | `percentage, totalTokens, maxTokens, categories, autoCompactThreshold, …` |

## 4. Permissions ✅ fully host-controlled
- `canUseTool` fires for anything that isn't auto-allowed. Writes to Claude's own scratchpad folder and read-only commands such as `ls` are allowed without asking, exactly as in the CLI.
- The callback options include `title, displayName, description, decisionReason, suggestions, blockedPath, toolUseID, agentID, requiresUserInteraction`. That's enough to build the same approval card the CLI shows. `suggestions` (for example `setMode->session`) map to the "always allow" buttons.
- A deny with `message` is passed back to Claude, which adapts. `result.permission_denials` counts the denials.
- **AskUserQuestion** goes through `canUseTool` too. To answer it, return `{behavior:'allow', updatedInput:{...input, answers:{[question]: label}}}`. ✅ Verified.

## 5. Rewind ✅
- With `enableFileCheckpointing: true`, `rewindFiles(userMessageUuid, {dryRun:true})` previews the changes (`filesChanged, insertions, deletions`), and the real call restores them. Verified that a file Claude created is removed again.
- User-message uuids come from `getSessionMessages()` (or from the streamed messages).

## 6. Interrupt ✅, with a crash trap ⚠️
- `interrupt()` resolves in under 10 ms. The turn ends with `result: error_during_execution`, and **the session keeps working.** The next message is answered normally.
- ⚠️ **If the input stream is ended right after an interrupted (error) result, the SDK throws an uncaught `Error: Claude Code returned an error result` asynchronously.** In a shared engine process, that would kill *every* session.
  → **Design rule:** each `SessionHost` wraps its iterator in try/catch and the engine registers `uncaughtException` / `unhandledRejection` guards. A failure marks that one session as errored and never takes the process down.
- Claude Code itself blocks some commands, for example `sleep N` ("use Monitor instead"), and backgrounds long ones on its own (`run_in_background` → `background_tasks_changed` / `task_started`). The UI needs a **background tasks** indicator (`backgroundTasks()`, `stopTask()`).

## 7. Live session state ✅, behind an env flag
- `system:session_state_changed` (`running` / `requires_action` / `idle`) is **only emitted when `CLAUDE_CODE_EMIT_SESSION_STATE_EVENTS=1`** is in the session's `env`. With it set, we saw `running > requires_action > running > idle`. That sequence is exactly the sidebar status dot.

## 8. Pre-warm ✅ worth it
- `startup({options})` takes about 550 ms, and is paid while the user is still typing. It brings time to first token down from about **2.4 s to 1.0 s**. Keep one warm instance per recently used folder.

## 9. On-disk formats ✅ readable, ⚠️ undocumented
**Live registry `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`.** Keys: `pid, sessionId, cwd, startedAt, procStart, version, peerProtocol, peerFeatures, kind, entrypoint, hostSessionId, pidDomain, messagingSocketPath, name, nameSource, nameSince, status (busy|idle), updatedAt, statusUpdatedAt`.
- **SDK sessions register here too** while running. That's useful, because the app can see its own sessions from the CLI's point of view, and other tools can see the app's sessions.
- `entrypoint` is inherited from the parent environment. These tests ran from inside Claude desktop, so they show up as `claude-desktop`. **The engine should set its own `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`** (to be confirmed which values are accepted) so origin badges are correct. Fall back to the app's own list of session ids.
- `messagingSocketPath` is a live Unix socket for each session. **Not touched in this spike**: connecting to another live session's control socket is out of scope for v1, as planned.

**Transcripts `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<id>.jsonl`.** 122 transcripts and 228 MB on this machine.
- `listSessions()` (all): **58 ms**. It reads file heads and tails, not whole files. It returns `sessionId, summary, lastModified, fileSize, customTitle, firstPrompt, gitBranch, cwd, tag, createdAt`.
- A full raw JSONL parse of everything took 0.6 s, which is fine as a one-off in a worker followed by incremental byte-offset reads.
- Useful metadata records for the sidebar: `ai-title`, `custom-title`, `agent-name`, `cost-state` (cost, lines added/removed, model usage), `pr-link` (PR number and URL), `permission-mode`, `mode`, `last-prompt`.
- Conversation records: `user`, `assistant`, `attachment`, `system:*`, and `file-history-*` (rewind checkpoints).

## 10. Worktrees ✅ Claude Code does it for us
- `claude --worktree <name>` creates the worktree at **`<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>`** on branch **`worktree-<name>`**, and marks it `locked`.
- **From the SDK:** `extraArgs: { worktree: '<name>' }` does the same. `init.cwd` reports the worktree path. So the app passes a flag and Claude Code applies the user's `worktree` settings (`baseRef: fresh|head`, `symlinkDirectories`, `sparsePaths`). There's no custom git code to keep in sync.
- The default `baseRef` is `fresh` (from `origin/<default-branch>`). With no `origin` it falls back to HEAD.
- `listSessions({dir: repo})` includes the repo's worktree sessions (`includeWorktrees` defaults to true), so grouping under the main repo comes for free.
- ⚠️ `gitBranch` in session info showed `main` for the worktree session. **Get the branch from git for the session's cwd** instead of trusting that field.

## 11. Storage ✅
- `node:sqlite` in Node 24 has **FTS5** (SQLite 3.53.4), so global search needs no native module. Latest Electron is **44.5.1**. Phase 1 must confirm that Electron's bundled Node includes `node:sqlite`. Fall back to `better-sqlite3` if it doesn't.

## Side effects of running the spike
- About 12 short Haiku test sessions now exist in `~/.claude/projects/` under the scratchpad sandbox repo path, with a few cents of usage.
- Two locked worktrees (`spike-wt`, `spike-sdk`) exist inside the scratchpad sandbox repo. Nothing touched your real projects.
